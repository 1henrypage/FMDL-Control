# BRF Neurons: Controlled Dataset
This is my controlled dataset aimed to show the problems of RF neurons. Run the associated python file with the relevant dependencies. This will create the datasets in the current directory. It also generates 2 visualisations that aim to show the problems talked about in the paper.
